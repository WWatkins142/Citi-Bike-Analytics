## Questions? 
1. What are the three most popular Citi Bike locations in New York City in the month of August? 
2. What are the most popular departure times from the three most popular Citi Bike Stations in NYC during August? 

## Findings/ Analysis
During the month of August Citi Bike riders are using Start and End Stations across the city. The most popular Start and End Citi Bike stations are Pershing Square North, West St & Chambers St. and 12 Ave & W 40 St. All of these stations are near popular tourist locations as well as areas that would be most utilized by locals. 
<br> 
<br>
- Pershing Square North is only one block away from Grand Central Terminal's entrance, one of the major commuting hubs in New York City. 
- West St & Chambers St station is conveniently located on the Hudson River Greenway, a perfect station to begin or end the 11-mile scenic path.
- 12th Ave & W 40 St station is ideally located beside the Midtown Ferry NY waterway station. For passengers arriving from and departing to New Jersey by ferry this would be the station of choice. It is also located on the Huston River Greenway for use as a start or end point.
<br>
<br>
The most popular Departure times from the top three stations are 5PM, 6PM and 8AM. <br>
While all the Top 3 stations have increased ridership at 8 AM and from 4PM to 7PM, popular commute times, only the 12 Ave & W 40 St station has most of its riders at 8 AM. This station is located near a popular Ferry NY waterway that would see riders arriving by Ferry from New Jersey into New York City's largest business district (Midtown) most weekday mornings and for leisure on the weekends. The West St & Chambers St Citi Bike station has more riders at 6pm in August. With its proximity to the Hudson River Greenway this could be a prime location for riders embarking on a evening bike ride after typical work hours. 

## Recommendations
The top three stations, Pershing Square North, West St & Chambers St. and 12 Ave & W 40 St, should be routinely monitored for low inventory and bikes that need to be replaced. Unavailable or un-rideable bikes in these locations will have a significant impact on revenue. Also, each station should be serviced daily prior to the hours of 8AM and 5PM when there is a significant increase in demand for bikes. More stations could be placed near these locations to help relieve demand.
